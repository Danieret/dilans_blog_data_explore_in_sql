PostgresSQL_segmentation_exploratory analysis
After performing exploratory analysis, I continued making a cohort analysis in Python.
The presentation and the SQL and Python codes are on the master branch.

 Customer wants to spend more time and more money on his business. He wants to focus on one country first.

So the main questions are:
1 - In which country should he prioritise his effort and why?
2 - How can he be smart with his investments?
3 - Are there any other interesting insights from the data that he could benefit from?
